# TODOITI todo webb app
## Features defined by Ubiquiti
### Required
- [x] I as a user can create to-do items, such as a grocery list
- [x] I as another user can collaborate in real-time with user - so that we can
(for example) edit our family shopping-list together (*in task view*)
### Optional

- [x] I as a user can mark to-do items as “done” - so that I can avoid clutter and focus on
things that are still pending
- [x] I as a user can filter the to-do list and view items that were marked as done - so that I
can retrospect on my prior progress (*subtasks in task view*)
- [x] I as a user can add sub-tasks to my to-do items - so that I could make logical groups of
tasks and see their overall progress
- [x] I as a user can create multiple to-do lists where each list has it's unique URL that I can
share with my friends - so that I could have separate to do lists for my groceries and
work related tasks (*can create invite url in task view*)
- [-] I as an owner/creator of a certain to-do list can freeze/unfreeze a to-do list I've created to
avoid other users from mutating it (*Can be done data-wise/from database but not from UI*)

## Features by me
- [x] As a user I can create a new account on my own, login and logout to have proper privacy
- [x] As a user I can be confident my tasks cannot be accessed without my approval (invite created by me) by other people (*access control system*)
- [x] As a user I can mark whole todo list (including subtasks) as done directly from main view and also task view
- [x] As a user I can delete whole todo list directly from main view 
- [x] As a user if I add new task to a todo list marked as "done", the todo list is opened again
